# The Remède project

Remède is a free and open dictionary for everyone. Let's discover its story !
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## The beginning

Hi ! I'm Armand the maintainer and creator of Remède. I created Remède in October 2023 because I switched to an android 
phone, and the proprietary dictionary "Antidote" is only available on iOS phones.

Remède is a synonym of "Antidote" and its goal is to provides a **free**, **open** and **collaborative** dictionary 
available for **any platform**.

## The concept

My main goal is to provide a dictionary which is easy and pleasant to use ! I also wanted Remède to have **his own
database**.

Today, Remède is a dictionary but it includes **a corrector**, **a rimes dictionary** and **french cheatsheets** !
