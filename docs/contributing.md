## Add words

Remède fetches words from the Wiktionary but sometimes, words are not in our list so, you can add custom words...

You can add custom or missing word in our wordlists with ease.
1. Check on the [french Wiktionary](https://fr.wiktionary.org) if your word exist (or the Wiktionary in the language you want to add the word).
   1. If it is not referenced on the Wiktionary, add it to `data/custom_words.json` as JSON (using [Remède Document Schema](/docs/database/schema)). The `data/custom_words.json` file looks like `{ "you-word": { /* Remède document */}" }`
   2. Don't forget to cite your sources (link of your resources) in `sources` field.
2. Using the script `add_word.py`, quickly add you word to the database. It will also add it to the [Dataset](/docs/database/dataset) files.
```shell
python3 scripts/add_word.py my-word /its ipa notation/ 
```
